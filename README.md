# INBOX SOLIDITY CONTRACT

This is my first solidity contract and it does the basic task of _setting an initial string/message_ or _ALtering the set string/message_. This contract has been deployed on the **Rinkeby Test Network**

To deploy this contract-
1. Make a metamask account and copy the 12 words mnemonic phrase in the _phrase_ field as shown in image below. Make sure you've selected the Rinkeby test network.
2. Sign up at [Infura.io](https://infura.io/) & copy your unique url provided by them in the _providerOrUrl_ field.

Once you've successfully completed these steps, after running the **deploy.js** your terminal should give you the output as-

You can check information about your deployed contract by going to [](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/) website. Copy the address that your contract deployed to and search.
